particle_id,Unique particle identifier
set_id,Set (embryo) of particle
stripe_id,Vector of relative stripe positions as a function of time. Decimal indicates anterior/posterior positioning. E.g. 2.67 indicates anterior flank of stripe 3. 3.3333 indicates posterior flank of 3
time,Time in seconds. Interpolated to 20s res.
fluo,Interpolated fluorescence
p_off,Probability promoter is in  active state
p_on,Probability promoter is in inactive state
v_state_sp,Viterbi-decoded promoter state using stripe-specific params (1=off 2=on)
v_fluo_sp,Implied Viterbi Fluorescence (stripe specific)
v_state_agg,Viterbi-decoded promoter state using stripe-specific params (1=off 2=on)
v_fluo_agg,Implied Viterbi Fluorescence (stripe specific)
k_on,On rate. Value for each row reflects average taken across all bootstrap inference results for the relevant region in time and space
k_off,Off rate. Value for each row reflects average taken across all bootstrap inference results for the relevant region in time and space
initiation_rate_off,Basal initiation rate. Value for each row reflects average taken across all bootstrap inference results for the relevant region in time and space
initiation_rate_on,Active initiation rate. Value for each row reflects average taken across all bootstrap inference results for the relevant region in time and space
